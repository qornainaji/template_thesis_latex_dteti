ABSTRACT={This preliminary study employs a phenomenological approach to investigate the phenomenon of self-regulated learning among higher education students in the United Kingdom. The research identifies both facilitators and challenges associated with effective self-regulated learning. Through indepth interviews and thematic analysis, key themes such as motivation, the learning process, support systems, planning, and group dynamics emerge.Noteworthy findings include the importance of clear guidelines regarding study hours and designated learning environments for students.Furthermore, educators are encouraged to integrate activities fostering learning strategies and promoting social relationships within student groups.The study highlights the necessity for additional tools and support mechanisms, even for students who exhibit autonomous motivation, to enhance their effectiveness in self-study practices.}}

ABSTRACT={The current study examines the effect of teacher feedback on fostering self-regulated English-as-a-foreign-language(EFL) writers. Adopting aquasi-experimental design, this study was conducted among seventy students from two parallelintact English writing classes at the tertiary level. While conventional feedback at the level of task was used in the control group, feedback at the level of process and self-regulation with supplementary activities was adopted for the treatment group. This SRL-based feedback intervention lasted one semester. Students took a pre-test, an immediate and a delayed post-test to measure their improvement in English writing performance, as well as their use of writing strategies for self-regulated learning(SRL), with a questionnaire. The results reveal that the SRL-based feedback intervention had a positive impact on EFL student writers’ writing performance as well as their reported use of SRL writing strategies. While the analytic writing scores for the subcategories of organisation, vocabulary and content significantly increased overtime for the treatment group, there was little change in languageuse. ANCOVA analyses suggest significantly positive results for the treatment group in the improvement of SRL writing strategies with goal-oriented monitoring, knowledge rehearsal, feedback handling, and interest enhancement, and the intervention also developed the use of SRL strategies for text processing, idea planning, motivational self-talk, and emotional control.}}

  abstract  = {A recent challenge in distant distributed learning courses is to establish effective collaboration in small teams. Team work in such courses often has to take place asynchronously, which puts additional requirements on communication and coordination. This article describes an ongoing project in which we analyze the dynamics of virtual student teams located in different Universities by examining their Trello activity. The students work together in a project where they need to propose a solution for a business challenge. On the basis of their Trello activity we aim to characterize different patterns of team work in geographically dispersed teams to better understand how collaboration in virtual students teams develops over time. These insights can be used to detect ineffective team dynamics and to generate interventions that promote better collaboration.},
