The implementation of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in higher education faces challenges regarding the scalability of providing high-quality personalized feedback from instructors. This study aims to improve the quality of pedagogical feedback generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in a Kanban-based learning environment by utilizing Context Engineering enriched with Learning Analytics (LA).





This research employed an experimental method using synthetic student activity data on a Kanban platform for an Object-Oriented Programming course. Two LLM models, Llama 3.1 8B Instant and Llama 3.3 70B Versatile, were tested using four prompt variations: Baseline, Material List, LA, and a combination of ReAct + LA . Feedback quality was evaluated quantitatively using BERTScore, BARTScore, and LLM-as-a-Judge metrics, as well as qualitatively through validation by educational psychology experts .





The results indicate that integrating Context Engineering with Learning Analytics effectively improves feedback quality, although its efficacy depends on the model size. For the smaller model (8B), the use of complex methods (ReAct + LA) consistently yielded the highest performance improvements. Conversely, the larger model (70B) demonstrated superior baseline performance but degraded when presented with overly complex contexts, performing optimally with simpler contexts . Expert validation confirmed that the feedback generated by the best-performing model is usable with minor revisions, particularly regarding tonal adjustment and feedback specificity. This study concludes that analytics-driven context engineering is an effective and efficient strategy to support student SRL.
